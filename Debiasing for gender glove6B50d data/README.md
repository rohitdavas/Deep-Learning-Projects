## Hi there,

This is a fun project with glove 6 billion 50 dimensional data. 

What we see in this 
  - How to read a text dataset like glove6B50d
  - finding the cosine similarity
  - Debiasing 
  - Neuralising towards the gender biasness
  - Equalising for gender biasness


**Dataset**
Due to big file size I can't upload it here. Download from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/watts2/glove6b50dtxt/)
- extract it into data folder
